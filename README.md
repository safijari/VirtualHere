# VirtualHere: Steam Deck Plugin For Using the Deck Controller on other PCs with VirtualHere

<!-- ![Shotty Example Screenshot](shotty-screenshot.png) -->
Simple plugin to run virtualhere on the Steam Deck and share the Deck's controller (or other peripherals) with another machine.
Great for using the Deck as a separate controller or being able to use moonlight with certain games where VigEm gets flagged by the anticheat.

Note: When the Deck controller is connected to another device it won't be available to the Deck itself. This plugin makes it so that you can open the
Quick Access Menu by hitting both volume buttons together. This will allow you to go to the plugin page again and disable it which will reconnect the Deck
controller back to the Deck.
